[http://bochs.sourceforge.net/ Bochs] is a x86 emulator.

= Required packages =
* bochs
* bochs-x (to be displayed on X11 window system)

= Errors =
== dlopen failed for module 'x': file not found ==
Bochs is trying to find the X11 display driver, just install the 'bochs-x' package

== ROM: System BIOS must end at 0xfffff ==
BIOS file must end at 0xfffff address, so you need to get the size of the BIOS file in bytes and sustract it from 0xfffff at bochsrc.txt. For example, for a file of 131072 (0x20000) bytes the begining address is 0xe0000:

 romimage:       file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest, address=0xe0000
