= Gaia =
Gaia is an exokernel/framework designed based on [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html Multiboot Specification] and with the intention to be very clear and understable.

The long term purpose is to serve as basis to develop a pure user-space kernel on top of it that could desmitify operating system development.


== Dependencies ==
* GCC
* NASM
* QEmu (for testing development)
* Eclipse (optional, just make development easier and pretty :-) )

== Building the Project ==
From command line, just type ''make'' and later ''make run'' to exec it with QEmu (it's being done using the QEmu --kernel command line argument). Also the makefile is integrated in the Eclipse project, so you could be able to build and launch inside it as usual.
