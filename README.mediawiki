= Gaia =
Gaia is an exokernel/framework designed based on [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html Multiboot Specification] and with the intention to be very clear and understable. Uranus is an implementation of a pure user-space, event-driven UNIX-like OS microkernel build over Gaia.

The long term purpose is to serve as basis to develop a pure user-space kernel on top of it that could desmitify operating system development.

This code can be found at [https://github.com/piranna/Gaia GitHub]. Currently it's unmaintained in benefict of [http://code.google.com/r/piranna-p14p/ PyMite4Multiboot], a port of PyMite Python virtual machine to x86 platform. On the other hand, it's a sucessful sign since all the base code is recicled from libGaia core source code, and thanks to it in the future i will make libGaia an independent project common to both and re-start development of Gaia using it as basis.


== Dependencies ==
* GCC
* NASM
* QEmu (for testing development)
* Eclipse (optional, just make development easier and pretty :-) )

== Building the Project ==
From command line, just type ''make'' and later ''make run'' to exec it with QEmu (it's being done using the QEmu --kernel command line argument). Also the makefile is integrated in the Eclipse project, so you could be able to build and launch inside it as usual.

== Tree hierarchy ==
All Gaia and Uranus source code is inside 'src' folder:

* ''asm'': assembler specific source code, one folder for each platform
* ''GaiaLib'': C standard lib for Gaia, in the future it could be substitude by NewLib
* ''libgaia'': Gaia exokernel core source code
* ''libgaia/lib'': libgaia data structures
* ''uranus'': source code of the Uranus user-space microkernel
* ''uranus/drivers'': Uranus event-drivent drivers
* ''uranus/keyboard_layouts'': keyboard layouts (currently only US)
* ''uranus/lib'': Uranus data structures
* ''uranus/eventmanager.c'': Uranus events pumper
* ''uranus/main.c'': Uranus microkernel main file
* ''uranus/syscall.c'': syscall interface to Gaia

* ''main.c'': main file of Gaia exokernel
